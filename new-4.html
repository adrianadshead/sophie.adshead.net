  Description of Project:
  </h2>
<br>
<h4>
  We created our own movie poster for a movie of our choice. I chose to make a poster for the film, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” I used Canva to put together a picture of a typewriter, a background design, a brick design, a picture of the actors, and some text together into a cohesive advertisement.

   Likes and Dislikes:

  <h4>
    Likes:
    <p> - I liked that I got to create a poster about a movie I enjoy, versus having to make a poster about a movie that was selected for me. </p>
    <p> - I liked designing a poster; it was a fun project that allowed me to be creative. </p>
    <p> Dislikes: </p>
    <p> - I did not like how the program was working. The program didn't allow me to select certain sizes for text or change the spacing between text, so part of my text got cut off. </p>

    If I did it again, what would I change?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    I would try to find a better picture for the typewriter. I would also figure out how to make the alignment work better on the page.
