  Description of Project:
  </h2>
<br>
<h4>
  We created an advertisement for either an existing company or a fake company that we created. I created an advertisement for Ticonderoga pencils. I included actual reviews of the product. I also filmed clips of me sharpening the pencil, spinning the pencil, and zooming in on the pencil, just like I've seen people who create ads and post the process on YouTube do. I then got to edit the videos together, along with some other scenes I created online with platforms like Canva, into a cohesive video that advertises the Ticonderoga pencils.

    Likes:
    <p> - I liked recording the videos and figuring out how to get the shots that I wanted. </p>
    <p> Dislikes: </p>
    <p> - I disliked that I wasn't able to just cut out the background of the video without paying for professional software. </p>

    If I did it again, what would I change?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    I would get a large sheet of green paper to use as the background when recording, and I would paint the toothpick that held up the pencil for some shots, to the same color of green, so it would get cut out properly with the free software.
