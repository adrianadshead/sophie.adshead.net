    Description of Project:
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    We animated a video of our choice in Wickeditor. I created a video with buttons, and the user was able to read the
    instructions on the screen and pick a button to click. Then, the video would jump to a scene that reflects the
    choice that the user made. If you clicked one of the buttons, a wall would appear, stopping a brick from crushing
    a person. If you clicked the other one, the person would get crushed, and the person would start bleeding. At the
    end of the clip, there is a button that allows the user to go back to the beginning and pick again to either see
    the same animation or see what the other choice would do.

    Likes:
    <p> - I liked creating an animation; it was fun and creative. </p>
    <p> - I also liked figuring out how to code buttons so the video could be interactive. </p>
    <p> Dislikes: </p>
    <p> - I didn't have anything that I really disliked. However, I found that because the animation is interactive,
      it couldn't be shared and viewed easily, and I wish that it could. </p>

    If I did it again, what would I change?

  <h4>
    If I did it again, I would probably either figure out how to just share the interactive video or make something
    else that wasn't interactive.
