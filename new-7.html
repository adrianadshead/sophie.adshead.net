  <h2>
    Description of Project:
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    Our assignment was to create a game on the Scratch coding website. I chose to create the snake game. In the game you
    control the direction of the snake's movement by using the arrow keys. When the snake hits a fruit icon, it gets a
    little bit longer, and you gain one point. If you hit the wall, the game ends. We also had to make it our own, so I
    added a cake icon which appears every 5 points you gain, the cake is worth 5 points.

    Likes and Dislikes:
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    Likes:
    <p> - I liked figuring out how to make the cake only appear every time you get 5 points. </p>
    <p> - I liked making the food item change fruit every time you hit it. </p>
    <p> Dislikes: </p>
    <p> - I disliked the limitations that are involved with only using select block types. I understand that it is a
      kids coding website and the point is the users get a taste at what coding is without having to actually code, by
      having a select number of blocks that do certain things. However, there were some things that I wanted to have in
      this game, that just weren't possible with the premade block options. </p>

    If I did it again, what would I change?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    I might pick a different game. I originally wanted to do chess, or checkers, but with the limited block options,
    that would be a nightmare to create. If I were to do it again on the Scratch website, I would probably choose
    something more unique and more complex such as a maze game that includes multiple enemies and/or has things you have
    to collect to open the gate and make it to the next level, or maybe Pac-Man, that would be fun to code.
