    Description of Project:
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    The assignment I chose to add here is the HTML coding assignment. This may be my second favorite assignment we did all semester (my favorite being this whole online portfolio assignment, I get to do so many cool things with this assignment). For this assignment, we were told to create a fan page for a movie/tv/book series that we like. I chose to make a fan page about my all time favorite book series, Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus. My website includes four internal pages and several external links to other websites. It includes a page each about the three main characters of the series, and the main antagonist.

    Likes:
    <p> - I liked getting to make a fan page about Percy Jackson, it is literally my favorite thing ever. (THANK YOU MR.B FOR MAKING THIS ASSIGNMENT!!!) </p>
    <p> - I liked learning about HTML coding and flex boxes, formatting, etc. It was very interesting and a lot more simpler than I thought it would be. </p>
    <p> - I liked getting to use W3schools to figure out things that I didn't know, and in general getting to problem solve on my own.</p>
    <p> - I liked everything about this project, the topic, the coding, the making of a real website (ish, it's only on code.org), everything.</p>
    <p> Dislikes: </p>
    <p> - I have nothing to put here. I LOVED this assignment. It was perfect. </p>

    If I did it again, what would I change?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h4>
    If I did this assignment again I would make the flex boxes a little different on the character’s pages so that there is a gap between the photo of the character and the description of the character.
    <p>I would also add more pages, and do all of the characters from the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and the Heroes of Olympus series (the continuation series).</p>
